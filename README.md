# goals-app
People are always trying to find better ways to stay productive. Since social media is a huge aspect of our lives, having the people around us to keep us accountable and motivated is the key to increased productivity. Our group decided to come up with #Goals because we realize that in our college lives, friendly competition is helpful in keeping us motivated. Allowing others to see how much we’ve actually accomplished throughout the day not only keeps us liable but also encourages productivity in their own lives. With a curated point system, users can accumulate points to win rewards. We’ve seen businesses such as FitBit succeed in fitness based competitions, and wanted to apply a similar idea to our app. Our will be able to document the tasks as they are completed for proof. We have different methods of verification such a photographic documentation and location based check-ins. Our target users include students, families, co-workers and more.
